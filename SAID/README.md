## TL;DR

**SAID** = **S**cientific **A**cademic **I**ntegrity **D**isclosure

## Master Repository & Auto-Sync

This SAID directory is **automatically synchronized** from the master repository:

üè† **Master**: [abba-01/abba/SAID](https://github.com/abba-01/abba/tree/main/SAID)

**How it works**:
- ‚úÖ Changes to SAID in abba repo trigger automatic sync to all repositories
- ‚úÖ Git post-commit hook runs `sync_said_to_all_repos.sh`
- ‚úÖ All repos stay synchronized with a single source of truth

**Manual sync** (if needed):
```bash
cd /run/media/root/OP01/got/abba
./SAID/sync_said_to_all_repos.sh
```
