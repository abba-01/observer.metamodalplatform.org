# SAID
## Scientific Academic Integrity Disclosure

## What is SAID?

**SAID** stands for **Scientific Academic Integrity Disclosure**. This directory contains transparency artifacts that document the ethical, methodological, and technical guardrails governing this research project.

---

## Purpose

The SAID framework ensures:

- **Transparency**: All AI collaboration, methodological constraints, and analytical boundaries are explicitly documented
- **Reproducibility**: Research processes are deterministic, traceable, and verifiable
- **Integrity**: No fabrication, speculation, or undisclosed inference in published outputs
- **Accountability**: Clear provenance for all claims, data sources, and computational artifacts

## Contents

### 1. `guardrails_v1_2025.json`
**BlackBox ThinkTank Mode Policy Manifest**

This JSON file defines the operational constraints for AI collaboration in this research project:

- **Bounded Analytical Behavior**: AI constrained to analysis, modeling, and artifact generationâ€”no narrative drift or speculative inference
- **Epistemic Neutrality**: Domain-agnostic, value-neutral processing
- **Verification Requirements**: All external data must include verifiable source, date, and confidence metrics
- **Truth Integrity Clause**: Prohibits fabrication; requires declaration of `NON-COMMITABLE` status when verification is impossible
- **Deterministic I/O**: Reproducible outputs with cryptographic hashing (SHA-256)
- **Audit Controls**: Iteration limits, state digests, and integrity checks

**Key Operational Modes**:
- **INFER**: Internal reasoning (hidden)
- **SYNTH**: Verifiable artifacts (JSON, code, tables)
- **REFLECT**: Confidence reporting with justification

---

## Why SAID Matters

As AI becomes integral to scientific research, **disclosure of collaboration protocols** is essential for:

1. **Peer Review**: Reviewers must understand the boundaries and constraints of AI-assisted analysis
2. **Replication**: Other researchers need explicit operational parameters to reproduce results
3. **Trust**: Transparent guardrails demonstrate commitment to rigorous, non-fabricated science
4. **Ethics**: Explicit boundaries prevent misuse and ensure responsible AI deployment

## Compliance Standards

This SAID framework aligns with:

- **JCGM Guidelines** (Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement)
- **IEEE Standards** for computational reproducibility
- **Open Science Principles** (transparency, provenance, verifiability)
- **Research Integrity Best Practices** (NIH, NSF, academic institutions)
